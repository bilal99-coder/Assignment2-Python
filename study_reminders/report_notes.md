challenges:
- could not import scheduler: find out that i have intsalled by pip install scheduler 
- i had not pip installed in my computer, i did not know how to install it 
- in the beginning i did not know what i will design the reminder app like 
- I had great experience from the previuos assignment because i structured the deliverable as packages and created unit tests.
- importing all the modules to __init__.py did not worked in the sense that i dont have to explicitly import modules in each file.
